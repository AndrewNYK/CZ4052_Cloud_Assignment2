Question: What is the first principle of security?,(A) Confidentiality,(B) Integrity,(C) Authentication,(D) Non-repudiation,Correct answer: (A),Explanation: Confidentiality is the first principle of security. It means that only the intended recipient should be able to read the message.
Question: What is the difference between symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography?,"(A) Symmetric key cryptography uses two keys, while asymmetric key cryptography uses one key.","(B) Symmetric key cryptography uses one key, while asymmetric key cryptography uses two keys.",(C) Symmetric key cryptography is more secure than asymmetric key cryptography.,(D) Asymmetric key cryptography is more secure than symmetric key cryptography.,Correct answer: (D),Explanation: Asymmetric key cryptography is more secure than symmetric key cryptography because it is much more difficult to crack.
Question: What is the purpose of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm?,(A) To encrypt messages,(B) To decrypt messages,(C) To generate a shared secret key,(D) To authenticate users,Correct answer: (C),Explanation: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is used to generate a shared secret key that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Question: What is the purpose of the RSA algorithm?,(A) To encrypt messages,(B) To decrypt messages,(C) To generate a shared secret key,(D) To authenticate users,Correct answer: (A),"Explanation: The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt messages. It is a public key cryptography algorithm, which means that one key is used to encrypt the message and a different key is used to decrypt it."
Question: What is the purpose of digital signatures?,(A) To encrypt messages,(B) To decrypt messages,(C) To authenticate users,(D) To verify the integrity of messages,Correct answer: (D),"Explanation: Digital signatures are used to verify the integrity of messages. They are a type of asymmetric key cryptography, which means that one key is used to sign the message and a different key is used to verify the signature."
Question: What is the difference between a public key and a private key?,"(A) A public key is used to encrypt messages, while a private key is used to decrypt messages.","(B) A public key is used to decrypt messages, while a private key is used to encrypt messages.","(C) A public key is used to sign messages, while a private key is used to verify signatures.","(D) A public key is used to verify signatures, while a private key is used to sign messages.",Correct answer: (A),"Explanation: A public key is used to encrypt messages, while a private key is used to decrypt messages. This is because a public key is known to everyone, while a private key is only known to the owner."
Question: What is a digital certificate?,(A) A digital certificate is a file that contains a public key and a digital signature.,(B) A digital certificate is a file that contains a private key and a digital signature.,(C) A digital certificate is a file that contains a public key and a private key.,(D) A digital certificate is a file that contains a private key and a public key.,Correct answer: (A),"Explanation: A digital certificate is a file that contains a public key and a digital signature. The public key can be used to encrypt messages, while the digital signature can be used to verify the authenticity of the message."
Question: What is the purpose of a trust anchor?,(A) A trust anchor is a trusted entity that can verify the authenticity of a digital certificate.,(B) A trust anchor is a trusted entity that can encrypt messages.,(C) A trust anchor is a trusted entity that can decrypt messages.,(D) A trust anchor is a trusted entity that can sign messages.,Correct answer: (A),Explanation: A trust anchor is a trusted entity that can verify the authenticity of a digital certificate. This is because a trust anchor has a public key that is known to everyone.
